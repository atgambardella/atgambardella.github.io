Andrew Gambardella graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in 2013, after which he took a position as the lead AI engineer for SoftBank’s humanoid robot, Pepper, at SoftBank’s main office in Tokyo, Japan. There he created an AI app, PepperVision, that allowed the robot to learn about, recognize, and interact with objects in the real world. Following this, Andrew took a position at the then-newly founded startup, Cogent Labs, where he worked on Japanese handwriting recognition and document clustering techniques. In 2017 Andrew started a DPhil at the University of Oxford in Engineering Sciences, concentrating on machine learning and artificial intelligence. He submitted his DPhil thesis on Bayesian transfer learning techniques in 2021, and thereafter worked as a researcher at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), applying his knowledge of machine learning to the arts. Since then Andrew has returned to Japan, and is currently working as a researcher of artifical general intelligence at the University of Tokyo, working under Japan's "godfather of AI," Professor Yutaka Matsuo.
