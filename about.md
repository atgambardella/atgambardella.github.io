I am Andrew Gambardella, postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Professor [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/). I previously spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST, and prior to that obtained my DPhil (PhD) in Engineering Science at Oxford, advised by Professor [Phil Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/). I research Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and other things that I believe would be useful on the path to creating an Artificial General Intelligence. 
  
During my undergrad years I studied EECS at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by [Satish Rao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~satishr/).

I have lived in the USA, Japan, Korea, and the UK. I speak fluent English and Japanese and less-fluent Korean and Chinese.
