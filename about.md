I am Andrew Gambardella, first-year DPhil (PhD) student at Oxford, advised by [Phil Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) and [Pushmeet Kohli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pkohli/). I am a member of St Catherine's College. I study Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and other things that I believe would be useful on the path to creating an Artificial General Intelligence. 
  
During my undergrad years I studied EECS at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by [Satish Rao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~satishr/).

I have lived in the USA, Japan, and the UK. I speak fluent Japanese and can passively understand Korean and Chinese.
  
You can find more (actually less at the moment) information on my [academic website](www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gambs/).
